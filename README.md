# FacebookVR
Created an application to demonstrate my teams understanding of human computer interaction. The task was to create a Facebook VR experience that had basic functionality. You can find the initial sketches and presentations for the app as well as a demo video can be seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL4sIdhSyAU&feature=youtu.be "Demo Video")
